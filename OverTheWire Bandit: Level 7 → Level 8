OverTheWire Bandit: Level 7 â†’ Level 8
Let me help you solve this level!
Challenge
The password for bandit8 is stored in the file data.txt next to the word "millionth".
Solution
First, connect to bandit7:
bashssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Once logged in, you need to find the password in data.txt. The file likely contains many lines, but you're looking for the one with "millionth".
Method 1: Using grep
The most efficient approach is to use grep to search for the specific word:
bashgrep "millionth" data.txt
This will output the line containing "millionth" along with the password next to it.
Method 2: Using cat and grep
Alternatively:
bashcat data.txt | grep "millionth"
Method 3: Manual search with less
If you want to browse the file:
bashless data.txt
Then press / to search, type millionth, and press Enter.
Expected Output
You should see something like:
millionth       [PASSWORD_HERE]
Key Learning

grep: A powerful tool for searching text patterns in files
Syntax: grep "pattern" filename
This is much more efficient than manually searching through large files

Once you have the password, use it to connect to bandit8:
bashssh bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
