# OverTheWire Bandit: Level 8 â†’ Level 9

## Objective
Find the password for **bandit9** stored in the file `data.txt`. The password is the only line of text that occurs **only once**.

## Connection Details
- **Host:** bandit.labs.overthewire.org
- **Port:** 2220
- **Username:** bandit8
- **Password:** [Use password from Level 7]

```bash
ssh bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

## Solution

### Step 1: Examine the File
Check what we're working with:
```bash
ls -la
wc -l data.txt  # Count the number of lines
```

The file contains many duplicate lines, but only one unique line.

### Step 2: Find the Unique Line
Use `sort` and `uniq` to find the line that appears only once:

```bash
sort data.txt | uniq -u
```

**Explanation:**
- `sort` - Sorts all lines alphabetically (required for `uniq` to work properly)
- `|` - Pipes the sorted output to the next command
- `uniq -u` - Displays only unique lines (lines that appear exactly once)

### Alternative Method: Count Occurrences
To see how many times each line appears:
```bash
sort data.txt | uniq -c | sort -n
```

This shows counts, and you can identify the line with count "1".

### Step 3: Verify
The output should be a single line containing the password for bandit9.

## Commands Used
- `sort` - Sort lines of text
- `uniq -u` - Report or filter out repeated lines (only unique)
- `uniq -c` - Prefix lines with occurrence count
- `wc -l` - Count lines in a file

## Key Concepts
- **Sorting**: Required before using `uniq` to group identical lines
- **Pipes**: Chaining commands together for powerful text processing
- **uniq utility**: Filtering duplicate lines in sorted data
- The `-u` flag shows only lines that appear once

## Why Sort First?
`uniq` only removes **adjacent** duplicate lines. Without sorting first, duplicates spread throughout the file won't be detected.

**Example:**
```
apple
banana
apple    # Won't be detected as duplicate without sort
```

## Next Level
Once you have the password, proceed to Level 9:
```bash
ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

## Notes
- The file contains mostly duplicate lines
- Only ONE line appears exactly once - that's your password
- Always sort before using `uniq`
