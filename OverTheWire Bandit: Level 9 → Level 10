OverTheWire Bandit: Level 9 â†’ Level 10

## Objective
Find the password for **bandit10** stored in the file `data.txt`. The password is in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several `=` characters.

## Connection Details
- **Host:** bandit.labs.overthewire.org
- **Port:** 2220
- **Username:** bandit9
- **Password:** [Use password from Level 8]

```bash
ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

## Solution

### Step 1: Examine the File
Check the file type:
```bash
ls -la
file data.txt
```

You'll see it's a binary/data file, not a regular text file.

### Step 2: Extract Human-Readable Strings
Use the `strings` command to extract readable text from the binary file:

```bash
strings data.txt
```

This outputs all human-readable strings found in the file.

### Step 3: Filter for Lines with Multiple `=` Signs
Since the password is preceded by several `=` characters, use `grep`:

```bash
strings data.txt | grep "==="
```

Or more precisely:
```bash
strings data.txt | grep "===="
```

**Output:**
You'll see several lines with `===` or more equal signs. Look for the one that appears to be the password (typically the last one or most obvious).

### Alternative: Show More Context
```bash
strings data.txt | grep -E "=+"
```

This uses regex to match one or more `=` characters.

## Commands Used
- `strings` - Extract printable strings from binary files
- `grep` - Search for patterns in text
- `file` - Determine file type
- `|` - Pipe operator to chain commands

## Key Concepts
- **Binary vs Text Files**: Not all files are plain text
- **strings command**: Extracts human-readable text from binary data
- **Pattern Matching**: Using `grep` to filter results
- **Data Extraction**: Finding needles in binary haystacks

## Understanding `strings`
The `strings` command looks for sequences of printable characters (at least 4 by default) within binary files. This is useful for:
- Finding embedded text in executables
- Extracting data from corrupted files
- Reverse engineering

## Next Level
Once you have the password, proceed to Level 10:
```bash
ssh bandit10@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

## Notes
- `data.txt` is a binary file, not plain text
- Don't use `cat` on binary files - it can mess up your terminal
- The password is preceded by multiple `=` characters
- `strings` is essential for extracting text from binary data

## Troubleshooting
If your terminal gets messed up after accidentally using `cat` on a binary file:
```bash
reset
```
