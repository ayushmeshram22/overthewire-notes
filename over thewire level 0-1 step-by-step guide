## Overview

This README covers the exact steps and common tools used to complete Bandit **Level 0 â†’ 1**. Itâ€™s designed to be a quick reference while you practice on the challenge server.

## Credentials & Connection

* **Host:** `bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
* **Port:** `2220`
* **Level 0 credentials:**

  * **User:** `bandit0`
  * **Password:** `bandit0`

**SSH command to connect:**

```

## Tools Used (what they do and examples)

### `ssh`

Secure shell â€” used to connect to the remote Bandit server.

```bash
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

Notes:

* `-p 2220` specifies the custom port Bandit uses.
* If you see a host key warning, use `ssh-keygen -R` to remove the old entry (see below).

### `ls`

Lists files in the current directory.

```bash
ls -la
```

Useful to check for files like `readme`.

### `cat`

Prints file contents to the terminal. Used to read the `readme` file containing the next-level password.

```bash
cat readme
```

### `file`

Identifies the type of a file (text, binary, etc.). Helpful if a file doesn't look like plain text.

```bash
file readme
```

### `less` / `more`

Pagers to view long files one page at a time. Quit with `q`.

```bash
less filename
```

### `ssh-keygen -R`

Removes an entry from `~/.ssh/known_hosts` if the server's host key changed.

```bash
ssh-keygen -R "[bandit.labs.overthewire.org]:2220"
```

## Quick step-by-step workflow

1. **Connect to the server:**

   ```bash
   ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
   ```
2. **List files in the home directory:**

   ```bash
   ls -la
   ```
3. **Read the `readme` file to get the password for level 1:**

   ```bash
   cat readme
   ```
4. **Log into level 1 using the password you found.**

## Tips & Safety

* Avoid putting passwords on the command line in long-term practice; let `ssh` prompt you interactively when possible.
* Donâ€™t share CTF passwords publicly if you plan to continue the challenge series.
* Use `less` for longer files to avoid flooding your terminal.
* If you encounter host key warnings, remove the old host key with `ssh-keygen -R "[host]:port"` and reconnect to accept the new key.
